# Quantum_Computing_Final
A repository containing all of the code that we used for our final project in CSCI-4961: Intro to Quantum Computing

## Project Overview

Tensor networks, originally developed in the physical sciences, have shown great potential in machine learning applications. This project demonstrates how tensor networks can be used for image classification, utilizing the TensorNetwork open-source library. We aim to replicate the high accuracy rates reported by Efthymiou et al. on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets and provide a detailed, step-by-step guide for implementing similar models.

## Contents

- **Introduction to Tensor Networks**: A primer on the key concepts of tensor networks, including matrix product states (MPS), tensor decompositions, and their relevance in machine learning.
- **Review of Methodology**: An in-depth breakdown of the methodology used by Efthymiou et al. to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.
- **Experimental Results**: A detailed account of our attempts to replicate the original experiments, including the setup, implementation, and results.
- **Discussion and Future Directions**: Reflections on the implications of tensor networks in machine learning and potential areas for further research.
